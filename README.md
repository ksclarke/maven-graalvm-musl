# maven-graalvm-musl

## Introduction

A Docker image that contains [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) (including its [native-image](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/) program), and the [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/) library. It's intended to be used as the first stage in a multistage Docker build that produces an Alpine image.
